  - Crypto connection for cryptocurrency data
- Real-time message broadcasting to all connected clients
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Credential management with multi-key support
- RESTful API endpoints for credential CRUD operations

### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript)
- WebSocket client with auto-reconnect
- Dynamic UI updates without page refresh
- Local storage for user preferences
- Responsive CSS with modern glassmorphism design

### Data Feeds
- **News Feed**: `wss://stream.data.alpaca.markets/v1beta1/news`
- **Stock Data**: `wss://stream.data.alpaca.markets/v2/iex` (IEX feed)
- **Crypto Data**: `wss://stream.data.alpaca.markets/v1beta3/crypto/us`

## Development

### Local Development (without Docker)
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### WebSocket Message Types

#### Client â†’ Server
- `auth`: Authenticate with Alpaca credentials
- `disconnect`: Close Alpaca connections
- `test_news`: Generate test news items
- `add_symbol`: Add symbol to stock watchlist
- `subscribe_top10_crypto`: Subscribe to top 10 cryptocurrencies

#### Server â†’ Client
- `news`: New news article
- `stock_trade`: Stock trade update
- `stock_quote`: Bid/ask quote update
- `crypto_trade`: Crypto trade update
- `crypto_quote`: Crypto bid/ask update
- `crypto_bar`: Crypto OHLCV data
- `auth_success`: Authentication successful
- `subscription_confirmed`: Successfully subscribed to data

## Troubleshooting

### No Stock Updates
- Stock data only updates during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- Crypto data updates 24/7
- Check Debug Console for subscription confirmations
- Ensure you're using valid Alpaca API credentials
- Paper trading keys work perfectly for market data

### Saved Keys Not Appearing
- Check that `credentials.json` exists in the project root
- Ensure the Docker container has proper file permissions
- Try saving a new key through the UI

### Connection Issues
- Verify your API credentials are correct
- Check the Debug Console tab for error messages
- Ensure Docker container is running: `docker ps`

### View Logs
```bash
docker logs alpaca-news-feed-alpaca-news-feed-1 -f
```

## API Rate Limits
- Alpaca provides generous rate limits for market data
- WebSocket connections are persistent (no request limits)
- Free tier includes real-time data access

## Security Notes
- API credentials are stored locally in `credentials.json` and `.env`
- Never commit `.env` or `credentials.json` to version control
- Both files are included in `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables in production
- Credentials are only transmitted over secure WebSocket (WSS)

## Docker Commands

### Build and Start
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### View Logs
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

### Stop Container
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Restart Container
```bash
docker compose restart
```
